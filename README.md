# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval


## Purpose

The goal of the project is to make real one's dream of opening a 'Surf n' Shake' shop in Hawaii. While there are savings, additional investor backing is needed. The source of this monetary support will be W. Avy, who is famous for his love of surfing. Due to his having a failed surf shop in the past, he wants to make sure this is a good investment. Specifically, he has concerns about the weather. With this in mind he wants the weather data set from Oahu, where the shop will be located, to be analyzed to show the viability of the venture. Initially he wants an analysis for the precipitation, temperature, and weather station statistics for the preceding year. For the challenge specifically, he wants to hone in on the months of June and December. This will prove to him without a doubt that the shop business is sustainable year round.


## Results

After some careful work the weather set for Oahu, provided by W. Avy, was analyzed with a focus on the months of June and December.

As one can see when comparing the charts both the months of June and December, that the temperature rangers are strikingly similar. The December average temperature of ~71 degrees is just about four degrees less than the June average temperature of ~75 degrees. When comparing the minimum temperatures there is a greater difference. For June the minimum temperature is 64 degrees and for December it is 56 degrees. This initally seems concerning but due to the close similarity in average temperatures it is reasonable to conclude that the very low end of temperature readings in December are outliers. While, there may be days where the 'Surf n' Shake' shop is not quite as busy
