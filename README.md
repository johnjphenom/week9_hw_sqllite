# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval


## Purpose

The goal of the project is to make real one's dream of opening a 'Surf n' Shake' shop in Hawaii. While there are savings, additional investor backing is needed. The source of this monetary support will be W. Avy, who is famous for his love of surfing. Due to his having a failed surf shop in the past, he wants to make sure this is a good investment. Specifically, he has concerns about the weather. With this in mind, he wants the weather data set from Oahu, where the shop will be located, to be analyzed to show the viability of the venture. Initially he wants an analysis for the precipitation, temperature, and weather station statistics for the preceding year. For the challenge specifically, he wants to home in on the months of June and December. This will prove to him without a doubt that the shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results

After some careful work the weather set for Oahu, provided by W. Avy, was analyzed with a focus on the months of June and December.

* The December average temperature of ~71 degrees is just about four degrees less than the June average temperature of ~75 degrees.
* The June high temperature of 85 degrees is just two degrees higher than the high temperature in December which is 83 degrees.
* When comparing the minimum temperatures there is a greater difference. For June the minimum temperature is 64 degrees and for December it is 56 degrees. This           initially seems concerning but due to the close similarity in average temperatures and high temperatures, but it is reasonable to conclude that the very low end of     temperature readings in December are outliers.



## Summary
The data clearly shows that at the two most extreme months, as far as highs as lows, consistently have temperatures that denote the high probability of the venture being successful. As one can see when comparing the charts both the months of June and December, that the temperature ranges are strikingly similar. While there may be days where the 'Surf n' Shake' shop is not quite as busy, as a whole the month of December is still viable for a steady flow of business. To get an even clearer picture of the climate during the months of June and December, it would be smart to also look at the precipitation for those months specifically. Also, the data could be better interpreted if only the weather stations with consistent readings were used. With the addition of these two parameters the support for the shop would be greater. W. Avy will be sure to sign on and the 'Surf n' Shake' shop can become a reality.
